# Programming And Scripting Homework for GMIT

## Objective of the project

The objective of this project is to develop a series of weekly exercises and tasks during the course of the PROGRAMMING AND SCRIPTING Course.

The different tasks have been worked on mostly using Python leaning on other platforms and software to carry out the different exercises.

### Weekly task 4

Write a program that asks the user to input any positive integer and outputs the successive values of the following calculation. At each step calculate the next value by taking the current value and, if it is even, divide it by two, but if it is odd, multiply it by three and add one. Have the program end if the current value is one.

$ python collatz.py

Please enter a positive integer: 10
10 5 16 8 4 2 1
